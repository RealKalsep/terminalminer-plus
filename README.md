# Tips
* Every step you do, it decreases 1 thirst. (1 step = lose 1 thirst)
* Stand on water to fill thirst!
* Can't break? Make sure you equipped a pickaxe (make sure you crafted it) or check the LOG. Is there "PICKAXE BROKE"?
* Can't play? Make sure you did everything in the instructions (How to install). Have you mistakenly downloaded Python 2? Have you checked path?
* Game running slow? Make sure you're not on water or having 0 Thirst (because that makes you slow), make sure you followed everything in the instructions (How to install) and that you don't have a bad computer for it.
* No colors? Make sure you have Windows 7 and higher, or use Mac (not tested with).

# Keys
